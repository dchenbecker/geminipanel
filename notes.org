* Notes for Gemini Capsule

** I2C Notes for MCP23017
- Addresses start at 0x20, and _all_ address pins must be pulled high or low as needed
- For consistent behavior, all input pins should have internal pullups enabled (GPPUA and GPPUB, 0xC and 0xD)
- Also, to make things consistent with pullups enabled, invert the input polarity (IPOLA and IPOLB, 0x2 and 0x3)

** Rust Development
- Need the rustup script to target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
